  <summary><h2>🚀 About Me</h2></summary>

  Great to meet you here! My name is Daniele and I would like to further deepen my knowledge of software development and work on exciting projects to gain practical experience. I am particularly      interested in **web development** and **data-driven applications**. My goal is to improve my skills and to explore the tech world. 💡   
  Away from the world of bits and bytes, I love spending time outside. Whether I’m hanging out with friends at the park, going for a bike ride, or just taking a walk to relax, being outdoors helps    me clear my head. I also enjoy exploring new places and trying out different activities. I enjoy exploring modern technologies and believe in **learning by doing!**
